Google APIs Client library for OCaml
====================================

**gapi-ocaml** is a simple, unofficial, OCaml client for Google Services. The
library supports ClientLogin, OAuth 1.0a, and OAuth 2.0 authentication.
Supported RESTful APIs:

* Calendar APIs v3 (JSON based)
* Google+ API v1
* Tasks API v1
* APIs Discovery Service v1
* URL Shortener API v1
* OAuth2 API v2
* Custom Search API v1
* Google Analytics API v3
* Page Speed Online API v1
* Blogger API v2

Old versions:

* Calendar Data API v2 (Atom based)

### Features

* Monadic interface
* [Functional lenses](blob/master/src/gapi/gapiLens.mli) to access data structures
* Service generator (experimental): a tool for generating client libraries for
  APIs based on the Google API Discovery format

Building gapi-ocaml
------------------

### Requirements

This library was developed with the following dependencies ([Unofficial OCaml
packages for Debian](http://ocaml.debian.net/debian/ocaml-3.12.1/)):

* [OCaml][] = 3.12.1
* [Findlib][] = 1.2.7
* [Ocamlnet][] = 3.3.5
* [Ocurl][] = 0.5.3
* [Cryptokit][] = 1.3.14
* [ExtLib][] = 1.5.1
* [json-wheel][] = 1.0.6
* [Xmlm][] = 1.0.2
* [pa_monad][] = 6.0 (syntax extension for Monads, optional)
* [OUnit][] = 1.1.0 (to build and run the tests, optional)

### Configuration and installation

This project provides 2 libraries:

* `gapi`: Google APIs client library
* `gdata`: Google Data Protocol client library

To build the libraries, run

    $ ocaml setup.ml -configure
    $ ocaml setup.ml -build

To install the libraries, run (as root, if your user doesn't have enough
privileges)

    $ ocaml setup.ml -install

To build and run the tests (you will need
[pa_monad](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~carette/pa_monad/)), execute

    $ ocaml setup.ml -configure --enable-tests
    $ ocaml setup.ml -build
    $ ocaml setup.ml -test

See [tests README](src/test/README.md) for further details regarding the tests.

To generate the documentation, run

    $ ocaml setup.ml -doc

Then you can browse the HTML documentation starting from
`gapi-ocaml.docdir/index.html`, but is not installed by default.

To uninstall anything that was previously installed, execute

    $ ocaml setup.ml -uninstall

### Usage

See [auth examples](examples/auth) for some examples of how to use
Google's authorization endpoints.

See [examples](examples) directory to find simple code samples that show usage
of some services.

See [service generator](tools/serviceGenerator.ml) for a complex example of
how to use functional lenses within the state monad.

See [tools README](tools/README.md) for the instructions of how to build and
run the service generator utility.
