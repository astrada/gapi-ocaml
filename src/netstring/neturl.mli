(** {1:interface Interface}
 *
 * This module provides functions to parse URLs, to print URLs, to
 * store URLs, to modify URLs, and to apply relative URLs.
 *
 * URLs are strings formed according to pattern (1) or (2):
 *
 * + [scheme://user;userparams:password\@host:port/path;params?query#fragment]
 * + [scheme:other;params?query#fragment]
 *
 * The word at the beginning of the URL identifies the URL scheme
 * (such as "http" or "file"). Depending on the scheme, not all of the
 * parts are allowed, or parts may be omitted. This module defines the
 * type [url_syntax] whose values describe which parts are allowed/required/
 * not allowed for a concrete URL scheme (see below).
 *
 * Not all characters are allowed in a URL. Some characters are allowed,
 * but have the special task to separate the various parts of the URL
 * (reserved characters).
 * However, it is possible to include even invalid or reserved characters
 * as normal content by applying the [%]-encoding on these characters:
 * A ['%'] indicates that an encoded character follows, and the character
 * is denoted by a two-digit hexadecimal number (e.g. [%2f] for ['/']).
 * In the following descriptions, the term "encoded string" means a string
 * containing such [%]-encoded characters, and the "decoded string" means a
 * string not containing such characters.
 * See the module {!Netencoding.Url} for functions encoding or decoding
 * strings.
 *
 * The type [url] describes values storing the components of a URL,
 * and the [url_syntax] for the URL. In general, the components are
 * stored as encoded strings; however, not for all components the
 * [%]-encoding is applicable.
 *
 * For convenience, the functions creating, modifying, and accessing
 * URLs can handle both encoded and decoded strings. In order to
 * avoid errors, the functions pass strings even in their decoded form.
 *
 * Note that there is currently no function to compare URLs. The
 * canoncical comparison ( [=] ) is not applicable because the same URL
 * may be written in different ways.
 *
 * Note that nothing is said about the character set/encoding of URLs.
 * Some protocols and standards prefer UTF-8 as fundamental encoding
 * and apply the [%]-encoding on top of it; i.e. the byte sequence
 * representing a character in UTF-8 is [%]-encoded.
 *
 * {b Standards Compliance}
 *
 * This module implements RFC 1738 and RFC 1808. There is also a newer
 * RFC, 2396, updating the former RFCs, but this module is not fully
 * compatible with RFC 2396. The following (minor) problems may occur:
 *
 * - The module escapes more characters than needed. All characters that
 *   are "unsafe" or "reserved" in either RFC document are escaped.
 * - URL parameters (appended with a ";") are handled as in RFCs 1738/1808.
 *   In RFC 2396, every path component may have parameters, and the
 *   algorithm to resolve relative URLs is different in this point.
 *   If it is required to apply RFC 2396, one can disable URL parameters
 *   in the syntax, and extract them from the path by a self-written
 *   postprocessor. Usually, this is only required for [imap] URLs.
 *
 * In one point, RFC 2396 is preferred:
 *
 * - Authorities may be terminated by a question mark, as in
 *   ["http://host?query"]. This is illegal in RFC 1738. The consequence
 *   is, however, that question marks in user strings must be escaped.
 *
 * RFC 3986 introduces IPv6 addresses. These are now supported (but see
 * the comments below).
 *)

exception Malformed_URL
(** Raised by a number of functions when encountering a badly formed
 * URL.
 *)

val extract_url_scheme : string -> string
  (** Returns the URL scheme from the string representation of an URL.
   * E.g. [extract_url_scheme "http://host/path" = "http"].
   * The scheme name is always converted to lowercase characters.
   * Raises [Malformed_URL] if the scheme name is not found.

type url_syntax =

      url_is_valid         : url -> bool;
      url_enable_relative  : bool;
    }
(** Values of type [url_syntax] describe which components of an URL are
 * recognized, which are allowed (and optional), and which are required.
 * Not all combinations are valid; the predicate expressed by the
 * function [url_syntax_is_valid] must hold.
 *
 * The function [url_is_valid] is applied when a fresh URL is created
 * and must return [true]. This function allows it to add an arbitrary
 * validity criterion to [url_syntax]. (Note that the URL passed to
 * this function is not fully working; you can safely assume that the
 * accessor functions [url_scheme] etc. can be applied to it.)
 *
 * Switch [url_accepts_8bit]: If [true], the bytes with code 128 to
 * 255 are treated like alphanumeric characters; if [false] these bytes
 * are illegal (but it is still possible to include such byte in their
 * encoded form: [%80] to [%FF]).
 *
 * Switch [url_enable_relative]: If [true], the syntax allows relative
 * URLs in principle. Actually, parsing of relative URLs is possible
 * when the optional parts are flagged as [Url_part_allowed] and not
 * as [Url_part_required]. However, it is useful to specify URL syntaxes
 * always as absolute URLs, and to weaken them on demand when a relative
 * URL is found by the parser. This switch enables that. In particular,
 * the function [partial_url_syntax] checks this flag.
 *)

and url
 (** Values of type [url] describe concrete URLs. Every URL must have
 * a fundamental [url_syntax], and it is only possible to create URLs
 * conforming to the syntax. See [make_url] for further information.

   * Notes:
   * - These syntax descriptions can be weakened for partial/relative URLs
   *   by changing the required parts to optional parts: See the function
   *   [partial_url_syntax].
   * - None of the descriptions allows fragments. These can be enabled by
   *   setting [url_enable_fragment] to [Url_part_allowed]. E.g.
   *   {[ { file_url_syntax with url_enable_fragment = Url_part_allowed } ]}
   * - 8 bit bytes are not accepted
   * - A large number of standardised scheme syntaxes are not available,
   *   e.g. gopher, prospero, wais. The selection is a bit subjective,
   *   but I have tried to omit protocols that are no longer in common
   *   use, or that are very special.
   * - The LDAP URL syntax (RFC 1959) does not fit into our scheme, it
   *   is omitted for now because of this.

      url
  (** Creates a URL from components:
   *
   * - The components [scheme] and [host] are simple strings to which the
   *   [%]-encoding is not applicable. [host] may be a (DNS) name, an
   *   IPv4 address as "dotted quad", or an IPv6 address enclosed in
   *   brackets.
   * - [addr] also sets [host], but directly from an [inet_addr].
   * - The component [port] is a simple number. Of course, the [%]-encoding
   *   is not applicable, too.
   * - [socksymbol] sets both [host] and [port] from the socksymbol of
   *   type [`Inet] or [`Inet_byname].
   * - The components [user], [password], [query], [fragment], and [other]
   *   are strings which may contain [%]-encoded characters. By default,
   *   you can pass any string for these components, and problematic characters
   *   are automatically encoded. If you set [encoded:true], the passed
   *   strings must already be encoded, but the function checks whether
   *   the encoding is syntactically correct.
   *   Note that for [query] even the characters ['?'] and ['='] are encoded
   *   by default, so you need to set [encoded:true] to pass a reasonable
   *   query string.
   * - The components [user_param], [path] and [param] are lists of strings which may
   *   contain [%]-encoded characters. Again, the default is to pass
   *   decoded strings to the function, and the function encodes them
   *   automatically, and by setting [encoded:true] the caller is responsible
   *   for encoding the strings. Passing empty lists for these components
   *   means that they are not part of the constructed URL.
   *   See below for the respresentation of these components.
   *
   * [socksymbol] has precedence over [addr], which has precedence over
   * [host]. [socksymbol] also has precedence over [port].
   *
   * The strings representing the components do not
   * contain the characters separating the components from each other.
   *
   * The created URL must conform to the [url_syntax], i.e.:
   * - The URL must only contain components which are recognized by the
   *   syntax
   * - The URL must contain components which are required by the syntax
   * - The URL must fulfill the predicate expressed by the [url_is_valid]
   *   function of the syntax.
   *
   * The path of a URL is represented as a list of ['/']-separated path
   * components. i.e.
   *
   * [ [ s1; s2; ...; sN ] ]  represents the path
   *                        [s1 ^ "/" ^ s2 ^ "/" ^ ... ^ "/" ^ sN]
   *
   * As special cases:
   * -  [[]]                   is the non-existing path
   * -  [[ "" ]]               is ["/"]
   * -  [[ "";"" ]]            is illegal
   *
   * Except of [s1] and [sN], the path components must not be empty strings.
   *
   * To avoid ambiguities, it is illegal to create URLs with both relative
   * paths ([s1 <> ""]) and host components.
   *
   * Parameters of URLs ([param] and [user_param]) are components
   * beginning with [';']. The list
   * of parameters is represented as list of strings where the strings
   * contain the value following [';'].

   * this function. If the URL is relative, it is tried to make it
   * absolute by resolving it relative to [base]. If there is no [base]
   * or if the the base URL does not allow the parts that would be added
   * (e.g. if the anonymous URL possesses a fragment and [base] does not
   * allow that), this will fail, and the function raises [Malformed_URL].
   *)

val file_url_of_local_path : ?getcwd:(unit -> string) -> string -> url
  (** Generates a URL with "file" scheme from the passed path name. The
   * URL is always absolute, i.e. the current directory is prepended if the
   * path is not absolute.
   *
   * Note that no character set conversions are performed.
   *
   * Win32: The input path name may use forward or backward slashes.
   * Absolute paths with drive letters and UNC paths are recognised.
   * Relative paths with drive letters, however, are not recognised
   * (e.g. ["c:file"]), as it is not possible to access the drive-specific
   * working directory from the O'Caml runtime.
   *
   * Cygwin: The input path name may use forward or backward slashes.
   * Absolute paths with drive letters and UNC paths are recognised.
   * The former are translated to ["/cygdrive"] names.
   *
   * @param getcwd The function returns the path taken as current working
   *   directory. Note that for
   *   Win32 this must be either an absolute name with drive letter,
   *   or an UNC path. Default: [Sys.getcwd]
   *)

val local_path_of_file_url : url -> string
  (** Extracts the path from an absolute file URL, and returns a
   * correct path name.
   *
   * If the URL is not a file URL, or is not absolute, the function will
   * fail.
   *
   * Win32: The URL must either contain a drive letter, or must refer
   * to another host.
   *
   * Cygwin: Drive letters and remote URLs are recognised.
   *)
